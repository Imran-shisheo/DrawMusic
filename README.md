# DrawMusic / ScribbleSong

An original Flutter drawing-to-music application. DrawMusic is the repository name; ScribbleSong is the PRD's provisional original brand. Android development runs in Codex Cloud. The owner will build and test iOS on a local Mac.

## Start here

- [Product requirements](PRD.md)
- [Research gallery](research/index.html) and [evidence guide](research/README.md)
- [Development roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md) and [current status](docs/DEVELOPMENT-STATUS.md)
- [Android cloud setup](cloud/SETUP.md) and [first cloud task](cloud/FIRST-TASK.md)
- [Agent instructions](AGENTS.md)

## Current state

Research is complete. Cloud setup scripts and Android CI are prepared. Flutter implementation and remote build validation have not yet started; see current status for the latest verified milestone. No APK is available until cloud bootstrap and its build succeed.

## Android verification after bootstrap

```bash
source cloud/env.sh
bash scripts/check-android.sh
```

CI produces a debug APK under the workflow run's Artifacts section after successful checks. Download/unzip it and install app-debug.apk on your test phone. It is a development build, not a signed Play Store release.

## Research and asset ownership

Reference images and audio document source-app behavior. They must never be bundled in the product. This cloud starter includes 16 representative screenshots and source exports; the complete research remains in the original Mac checkout. See [cloud reference scope](docs/CLOUD-REFERENCE-SCOPE.md). The full local research includes private device captures; Git intentionally excludes camera-photo/cropper images, recipient suggestions, raw device dumps and invalid runs. Some provenance references are therefore local-only; see [publication scope](docs/RESEARCH-PUBLICATION.md). Use original or explicitly licensed shipping artwork, icons, templates and sounds with a provenance manifest.

No backend or account is required for the P0 creative workflow. Ads and purchases are deferred until core reliability. App code stays portable for later iOS testing; physical audio latency and platform integration need real-device validation.
